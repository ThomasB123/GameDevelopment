# Game Development and Multimedia Technologies Summative Assignment

This coursework requires you to develop and implement a game. You are expected to apply a good range of knowledge and skills learnt from this module to complete your work. The implementation can be done by PyGame or Unity. You should choose a suitable game genre and design a story matching the required theme. You should also design game machinations to control game progression and game object abilities. Finally, you should demonstrate an effective use of multimedia content.
